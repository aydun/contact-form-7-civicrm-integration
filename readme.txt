Contact form 7 CIVICRM integration.

== Description ==

This plugin adds integration for CiviCRM to contact form 7. With this plugin it is possible to submit a contact for to an external CiviCRM.

Per contact form you could enable CiviCRM integration. The submission of the contact form is then submitted to the CiviCRM REST api. That is why you should also enter an CiviCRM entity and an CiviCRM action. The data in the form should then match the data for the api. E.g. if you push a first_name to the api your field should be called first_name.
